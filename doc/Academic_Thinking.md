as i want to use LLM to generate python script that generate AOE2.DE. but several problems i have: 
1. the generated map looks boring, it think this is due to the generated script is more like thinking linearly, and when that maps to 2d map, it lacks art. other 2D generated methodology like stable diffusion is actually trained itself using 2D data.... so i think if i use LLM, it feels wrong.....
