how to edit terrain of a scenario:


### example code snippet
for x in range(120):
    for y in range(120):
        tile = scenario.map_manager.get_tile(x, y)
        tile.terrain_id = 32  # ID 32
        tile.layer = random.choice([TerrainId.SNOW, TerrainId.FOREST_PINE])  # IDs 31,32
        tile.elevation = 1  # Uneven snowy ground

Elevation number is between 0 and 6.
Terrain_id chooses the base of the terrain
layer means some other terrain form layered on top of it. e.g. if base is Dirt , layer is SNOW, then we see in game map a dirt terrain with light snow on it. 
the layered mode is used to create more detailed, interesting, terrain. 
x, y is the coordinate in map
