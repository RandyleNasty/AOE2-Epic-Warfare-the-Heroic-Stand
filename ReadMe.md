 a scenario in AOE2 that... 4 v 4. where each side has very good defense wall and tower at the start, the battle happens at the center where 8 player there fight togther, the  other two sides are shut by river where globally dock is disabled. i also create some custom hero units for each player. Also the east side are set as AI where reinforcements are triggered when human players reaches certain point, like breaching the first line defense. Also the scene is created as beautiful as possible, the final target is a becautiful castle  and water surrounds it with beautiful waterfall.
