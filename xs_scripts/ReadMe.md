- how does XS scripting work with ASP?

Integration with AoE2 Scenario Parser
The AoE2 Scenario Parser simplifies working with XS scripts by managing their integration into scenarios:

Trigger Management: The parser creates triggers with "Script Call" effects to execute XS scripts.

Multiplayer Compatibility: It ensures that manually referenced XS files are transferred to other players in multiplayer lobbies, though spectators cannot access them.

Script Initialization: The parser automatically initializes triggers for XS scripts, allowing seamless integration without manual setup.
